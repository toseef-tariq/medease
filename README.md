# Abstract

The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any
user an easy way of booking a doctor‟s appointment online. This is a web based
application that overcomes the issue of managing and booking appointments according to
user‟s choice or demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the compounder
or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability.
Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots
available and select the preferred date and time. The already booked space will be marked
yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system also
allows users to cancel their booking anytime. The application uses Latest Web
Technologies as a front-end and PHP with MySQL database as the back-end.
